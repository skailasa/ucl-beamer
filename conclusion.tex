    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We're building Rust infrastructure for the O(N) forward and inverse application of a large class of integral operators that incorporates multiple levels of parallelism.
        \item Rust makes building and distributing scientific software easy.
        \item Ecosystem of numerics tools is growing.
        \item We're excited to be part of a larger movement!
