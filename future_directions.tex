    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Unification of fragmented software landscape for fast-solvers. Offer overview of what's out there and who's working on what, what is parallelized and what's not.
        \item FDS for high-frequency problems.
        \item Complete a first FDS for maxwell. What kind of problems would this allow us to solve? How close are we to this goal?
