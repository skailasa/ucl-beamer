    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Currently only uses sample sort for parallel sort, and balancing not yet implemented.
        \item Local sort using Rust's native implementation.
        \item Fully unit tested.
    \end{enumerate}

    TODO:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Implement and test HykSort, and whether it matters for our problem sizes.
        \item Morton keys are represented as vec of structs for clarity, though would be preferable to represent them as a struct of arrays for speed.
        \item Add balancing algorithm.
        \item Add API for higher level codes, i.e. easy access to interaction lists etc.
        \item Measure strong and weak scaling on cluster.
    \end{enumerate}

    Tested on my 6 core i7 laptop.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 6e6 randomly distributed particles (1e6 per core), ncrit=150, max depth=7.
        \item Unbalanced tree with 260688 leaf nodes.
        \item Runtime: 2.41 seconds. Peak Memory Usage: 1.9 GB.
    \end{enumerate}

    Interesting comparison, single node C++ implementation in ExaFMM-T, current state of the art, accelerated with OpenMP, for same problem has a runtime of 3.94 seconds with peak memory usage of 1.6 GB.
