abstract = {The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is a popular tool to solve Laplace and Helmholtz boundary value problems. Its main drawback is that it often leads to ill-conditioned systems of equations. In this paper, we investigate for the interior Helmholtz problem on analytic domains how the singularities (charge points) of the MFS basis functions have to be chosen such that approximate solutions can be represented by the MFS basis in a numerically stable way. For Helmholtz problems on the unit disc we give a full analysis which includes the high frequency (short wavelength) limit. For more difficult and nonconvex domains such as crescents we demonstrate how the right choice of charge points is connected to how far into the complex plane the solution of the boundary value problem can be analytically continued, which in turn depends on both domain shape and boundary data. Using this we develop a recipe for locating charge points which allows us to reach error norms of typically 10^-^1^1 on a wide variety of analytic domains. At high frequencies of order only 3 points per wavelength are needed, which compares very favorably to boundary integral methods.},

For a system of N particles, an amount of work of the order O(N2) has traditionally been required to evaluate all pairwise interactions, unless some approximation or truncation method is used. The algorithm of the present paper requires an amount of work proportional to N to evaluate all interactions to within roundoff error, making it considerably more practical for large-scale problems encountered in plasma physics, fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and celestial mechanics."
